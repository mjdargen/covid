Sometimes it can be difficult to sift through COVID-19 data to figure out what information is important and pertinent to you. It can be hard to find localized data or the localized data is poorly presented and indecipherable. This project aims to address that need.  

In this tutorial, I will teach you how to plot COVID-19 data on interactive graphs using Python. The data is pulled from the Johns Hopkins University. This project uses two very powerful libraries: Pandas and Plotly. It plots four key pieces of data: total confirmed cases, new cases per day, total confirmed deaths, and new deaths per day. This data is plotted over time since the start of the pandemic at the county and state levels for the United States.  

Always remember, stay safe out there and look after each other!  

To run this code in your environment, you will need to:  
   * Install Python 3 and pip
   * Install requests, pandas, plotly: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
